            <h3>Absolution</h3>
            <p>How does one seek forgiveness when said trangression goes beyond the actions of the transgressor?
                How does one improve behaviors when in order to do so one would have to put to an end the firmilar
                and in turn embracing the unknown. Forgiveness being something given not taken puts to bed all which
                came before. Someone's trangressions should be enough for them to seek said absolution, but instead
                forces retribution in it's place.

            <h3>The Quiet Collapse</h3>
            <p>The underlying ethos of humanity is one of profound sadness, misconstrue intentions
                and misplaced wants. The desperate, cold visions we are constantly held to stun our sense of self and
                collective identity. The relationships we claim to hold sacred are reduced to nothing more than a means
                to an end. The fleeting projections of status, consuming all it comes across, destroying far more than
                it gives. Punishing each other through perceived necessity and misplaced purpose. A silent killer,
                pride. The killer of all things just and progressive, yet is far weaker than it seems. A collective
                disease with no cure in sight. What else could it possibly take from us?

            <h3>Trumpism & The Nechizean Antichrist</h3>
            <p>In a world increasingly mesmerized by the lure of power and strength, one disturbing dynamic stands out:
                dominance, confidence, and bravado are measured as metrics for competency and desirability. This isn’t
                only deceptively wrong but also a precursor to interpersonal divisions and the corrosion of political
                and social norms. We are, through Nietzsche’s analysis, far better positioned to undergo setbacks toward
                superficial qualities rather than substantive growth and mastery qualities.
            </p>
            <p>Friedrich Nietzsche’s Übermensch represents the call for transcendence of mediocrity through
                self-overcoming, creativity, and forging new values via philosophical thought. In direct contrast with
                Nietzsche’s ideal stands the figure of a man who exudes from the surface a quality of an Übermensch
                through confidence, dominance, and the rejection of conventional norms but without the depth of
                philosophical or artistic self-conquering. Strong, a caricature of such strength, without introspection,
                discipline, and self-overcoming.
            </p>
            <p>This is a distortion of Nietzsche’s ideas, which most often comes out in leaders relying on spectacle and
                performance to project strength without substance. Leaders who don’t rule with a clear and logical mind,
                but with a reactionary iron fist. As Nietzsche himself warned, this hollowed-out version of the
                Übermensch risks steering society into rapid decay and regression.
            </p>
            <p>In and of themselves, such figures can only do so much harm. We know, however, that the vacuum was broke
                a long time ago. In an interconnected world, and an ever corrupting political landscape where systems
                propagate influence, a lack of philosophical depth in our leaders has negative implications for all. The
                result of which, only the perception of strength is valued leading in turn to the devaluation of
                critical thought, of empathy, of true capability only leaving brute force, and group think resulting in
                cultural warfare. We currently see this in the West with figureheads like Donald Trump and the rise of
                both far right and left groups, with differing goals and effects of course.
            </p>
            <p>Nietzsche warned against what he called “herd mentality,” a condition where societies surrender to
                superficial values and do nothing to create greatness. A society which confuses strength with competence
                could easily slip into such a position, where demagogues would be promoted in order to deplete its
                fabric. Nietzsche’s Antichrist is that critique of such values, which prefer the shell above substance-
                an effective warning in this direction. Addressing this would require a conscious cultural shift the
                likes of which we’ve never seen.
            </p>
            <p>The recognition that a society is strong and resilient not because of a projection strengths but from its
                capacity for competence, creativity, and integrity to it’s principles. A willingness to grow. The seeds
                sown by valuing the veneer of strength should be uprooted through a return to substance over spectacle.
                By embracing the deeper ideals of Nietzschean self-overcoming and rejecting hollow leadership, societies
                can sow renewal and growth. The choice is ours to make, and the consequences will shape the future.
            </p>

            <h3>The Free Will Problem</h3>
            <p>I’ve recently seen a discussion between Robert Sapolsky & Neil deGrasse Tyson regarding the question of
                whether freewill exists or not. This conversation was very enjoyable to watch touching upon topics I
                find interesting and worthwhile to discuss. While the question ‘Do we have free will or not?’ is
                appealing and even captivating enough for people, I think it’s the wrong one focus on. A much more
                important question would be: ‘Should we apply the principles that would arise from the discovery (if at
                all possible) that there is no free will, regardless of whether free will exists or not?’
            </p>
            <p>In my view, adopting these principles could be a transformative step for society. If we embrace the idea
                that free will is an illusion regardless of it’s validity, we might shift our approach to justice,
                moving away from punitive systems and toward more rehabilitative ones. This change would help reduce
                societal harm by fostering a more compassionate, protective, and rehabilitative form of justice and
                economic reform, rather than one driven by cathartic vengeance, retribution or a false sense of
                meritocracy.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of continuing to antagonize and stigmatize sections of the population deemed “undesirable or
                failures,” we would begin to focus on meaningful rehabilitation and support. By shifting our societal
                focus away from blame and punishment, we could reduce the cycle of barbarism and hostility that often
                perpetuates injustice, and the cycle of criminality. The key, then, is not necessarily in determining
                whether or not free will exists, but in how we apply the principles that would stem from such a
                discovery, principles that would lead us toward a more empathetic and constructive society.
            </p>

            <h3>Catharticism</h3>
            <p>The value of a society is not measured by the power it holds, but by what it chooses to do with said
                power. The rejection of barbarism is a thin veil that shields us from irrational, reactive impulses that
                harm not only their victims but consequently their perpetrators.
            </p>
            <p>When people and in turn a society embrace a sense of catharticism the collective consciousness becomes
                ill morphed. A game of emotional rants with no logic to back it up, in other words doing things because
                they feel good regardless if they’re truly good or not. This makes tyranny enviable, charlatans rise up
                to play on the fears of base. Values become a thing of the past leaving in it’s place group think. A
                non-option one must choose at risk of ostracizing, dehumanization and inevitably violent retribution. We
                currently live in such an age.

            <h3>False Motive</h3>
            <p>What we often perceive as the relentless pursuit of profit is, at its core, a misunderstanding of who we
                truly are. Beneath these drives lie the beliefs, fears, and emotions that shape us—our intrinsic desires
                for connection, fulfillment, and meaning. Profit, then, is not the end goal; it is merely a tool, a
                means to an end, that we mistakenly, addictively elevate above all else.
            </p>
            <p>The real battle we face is not only one of us versus them, but the ongoing struggle against our own
                vices, our desires shaped by faulty reasoning. These desires—rooted in false perceptions of what we need
                and who we should be—enslave us, making us vulnerable to exploitation. Profit-driven narratives thrive
                on this misunderstanding, distracting us from the true forces at work. These distractions, carefully
                orchestrated by those who benefit from our confusion, keep us focused on external conflicts and material
                gain, rather than the internal work necessary for meaningful change.
            </p>
            <p>At the heart of this battle is not the pursuit of wealth, but the pursuit of clarity, self-awareness, and
                ultimately, the liberation from the forces that manipulate our deepest desires. Everything else, it
                seems, is just a smokescreen to keep us from realizing the truth of our own existence.
